::: {.card title="Summary"}

- Effects are highly replicable irrespective of group framing, #agents, #issues, or sample n

- People are learning and creating clusters that exclude the deviant

- Is this the first paper that tests continuous deviance to identify threshold of when deviant gets pushed out? 

- Confidence only u-shaped when it’s Ps own group and groups are explicitly labeled suggesting increasing stereotype change in 1b’s and only subtyping in self studies

- Look more closely at non-non similarity ratings in 1b; these drop too as deviance increases! Whole structure is changing some bc of one person. 

- One possibility is paper is 1b.1-4 then self 2 (bc deviance is yolked to agents same as 1b) and then self 1

- Demonstrates how easily people learn structure, how it changes with increased deviance, that you can get subtyping at high levels of deviance with implications for ID with own group

::: {.card title="Ideas"}

Potential Intermediary Studies to bridge 1b and self:

- For 1b, add a high/low visual cue condition on political variability (descriptive norm) to beginning of study.

- For self, make agent responses to political statements based on actual political party positions.
