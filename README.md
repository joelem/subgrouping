# Subgrouping Analysis & Dashboards

This code produces a hierarhical Quarto dashboard that comprehensively shows the results for each experiment for an in progress project.

In this project, we are testing the effect of an virtual agent's deviation on the perceived social group structure within the group that agent belongs to. The project is a multi-component experiment that includes: agent learning in an opinion prediction task, a paired agent similarity rating task, and a prediction task for new agents. This script provides sample descriptive statistics, data preprocessing, modeling and plotting for each experiment component, and cross-language modeling with Julia for running more advanced computational models that R cannot easily handle.
